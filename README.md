This Android project showcases the implementation of a foreground service in an Android application. The foreground service is integrated with a continuously updating timer that is displayed in a notification. The timer increments every second, reflecting the elapsed time within the notification.

The primary features of this project include:

Foreground Service: Demonstrates how to create and manage a foreground service in Android.
Notification with Timer: Displays an ongoing notification with a timer that continuously updates to reflect the elapsed time.
Background Execution: The service runs in the background, allowing the application to perform tasks continuously without interruption.
The project serves as an illustrative example for developers seeking to understand how to implement foreground services in Android, especially those requiring persistent background tasks or ongoing operations. It provides a clear demonstration of how to create a service that operates in the foreground while providing regular updates to the user via a notification.
